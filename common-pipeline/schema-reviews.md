## 1.0 Schema Review
_(the deadline for this review is August 16th 2017)_
  
For the 1.0 version of the common specifications, we will be reviewing the following schemas and the associated examples that reside in folders beneath them.

### The following schema pertains to dataset metadata:
  * ./dataset-metadata/dataset-metadata-v1-schema.json

### These schemas are for the base operator, uihints, conditions, and categories:
  * ./operators/operator-v1-schema.json
  * ./operators/uihints-v1-schema.json
  * ./operators/conditions-v1-schema.json
  * ./operators/categories-v1-schema.json

### These schemas cover the common pipeline-flow format for document authoring and execution:
  * ./pipeline-flow/pipeline-flow-v1-schema.json
  * ./pipeline-flow/pipeline-flow-ui-v1-schema.json

### This schema defines input and output connections (data sources and sinks) for pipeline-flows:
  * ./source-target-pdr/source-target-pdr-v1-schema.json
